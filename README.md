# 🗳️ Live Poll — PowerPoint Add-in

Ask your audience multiple-choice questions during a presentation. They scan a QR code,
vote on their phones (any iPhone or Android — it's just a web page), and the results
bar chart updates live on the slide.

**What it can do**

- **Live polls** — one question per slide, live bar chart + QR code during the slideshow.
- **Quizzes** — optionally mark a correct answer. When you're satisfied with the votes,
  click **Reveal answer** right on the slide: the correct bar gets a ✓ and every phone
  shows whether its vote was right.
- **Session names** — name each presentation (e.g. the talk's title). Voters see it on
  their phones and in their results history.
- **Voter accounts (optional)** — voters can sign in to track their answers; the
  **My results** page shows every session they've answered, with scores.
- **Themes** — pick preset or custom colors; slides and voters' phones match.
- **New audience reset** — one button returns every count to 0 before you re-present.

**How it works:** each presentation gets its own session code (derived from the file, so
its QR code never changes). When a poll slide appears during the slideshow, every
connected phone automatically switches to that slide's question.

| File | What it is |
|---|---|
| `manifest.xml` | Tells PowerPoint about the add-in (you sideload this once) |
| `docs/widget.html` | The box on your slide: question editor while building, live chart + QR + reveal button while presenting |
| `docs/vote.html` | What the audience sees on their phones |
| `docs/review.html` | **My results** — a voter's answer history and quiz scores |
| `docs/host.html` | Optional presenter console (open/close voting, reset votes remotely) |
| `docs/index.html` | Simple landing page linking to the three pages above |
| `docs/poll-common.js` | Helper code shared by all pages |
| `docs/firebase-config.js` | Where you paste your Firebase keys (step 1) |

No server to run — pages are hosted free on GitHub Pages, votes go through Firebase
(free tier). To copy this setup, you only need a Google account (Firebase) and a
GitHub account.

## Setup (one time, ~25 minutes)

### Step 1 — Create a free Firebase database

1. Go to [console.firebase.google.com](https://console.firebase.google.com) and sign in with a Google account.
2. Click **Create a project** (or "Add project"). Name it anything, e.g. `live-poll`. You can turn off Google Analytics. Click through to create it.
3. In the left menu: **Build → Realtime Database → Create Database**. Pick the location closest to you, and choose **Start in test mode**.
4. Go to the **Rules** tab of the database and replace the rules with this, then click **Publish**:
   ```json
   {
     "rules": {
       "sessions": {
         ".read": true,
         ".write": true
       },
       "users": {
         "$uid": {
           ".read": "auth != null && auth.uid === $uid",
           ".write": "auth != null && auth.uid === $uid"
         }
       }
     }
   }
   ```

   The `sessions` section is deliberately open so voters can vote without accounts —
   fine for live polling, but don't store anything sensitive. The `users` section is
   required for the **My results** page: signed-in voters' answer history is stored
   under `users/{their-id}/answers`, readable only by them.
5. **Enable sign-in:** in the left menu, **Build → Authentication → Get started →
   Sign-in method**, enable **Email/Password** (just the first toggle), and save.
6. **Create your presenter account:** on the Authentication **Users** tab, click
   **Add user** and enter the email + password you'll use to sign in inside the
   PowerPoint widget. (Voters who want to track their results can create their own
   accounts directly on the voting page — you don't make accounts for them.)
7. Click the **gear icon → Project settings**. Under "Your apps", click the **`</>`** (web) icon to register a web app. Name it `live-poll`. Skip hosting. It shows you a `firebaseConfig` code block.
8. Open `docs/firebase-config.js` in this folder and replace the existing values with the ones Firebase showed you. **Make sure `databaseURL` is included** — if Firebase's snippet doesn't show it, copy it from the Realtime Database page (it looks like `https://live-poll-xxxxx-default-rtdb.firebaseio.com`). These keys are safe to publish — Firebase web keys only identify the project; the rules above are what control access.

### Step 2 — Put this folder on GitHub Pages

1. Create a free account at [github.com](https://github.com) if you don't have one.
2. Click **+ → New repository**. Name it e.g. `live-poll`. Keep it **Public**. Create it.
3. Upload this folder's contents: on the repo page, **uploading an existing file** link (or "Add file → Upload files") and drag in `manifest.xml`, `README.md`, and the whole `docs` folder. Commit.
4. In the repo: **Settings → Pages**. Under "Build and deployment", set Source to **Deploy from a branch**, branch **main**, folder **/docs**. Save.
5. Wait a minute, refresh the Pages settings page — it shows your site URL, e.g.
   `https://yourname.github.io/live-poll/`
6. Test it: open `https://YOUR-URL/vote.html` in a browser. You should see the dark "Live poll" page.

> **Whenever you change a file later, re-upload it to the repo** — PowerPoint loads
> the widget from GitHub Pages, not from your computer. An out-of-date `widget.html`
> on GitHub is the most common reason a new feature "doesn't work".

### Step 3 — Point the manifest at your site

Open `manifest.xml` and replace every
`proceduralist.github.io/live-poll`
with your real address (e.g. `yourname.github.io/live-poll`). There are 4 places.
Re-upload the fixed `manifest.xml` to GitHub too (not required for the add-in to work, just to keep it backed up).

### Step 4 — Install (sideload) the add-in into PowerPoint

**Mac:**
1. Open Terminal and run (adjust the path to wherever this folder is):
   ```bash
   mkdir -p ~/Library/Containers/com.microsoft.Powerpoint/Data/Documents/wef
   cp "/path/to/this/folder/manifest.xml" ~/Library/Containers/com.microsoft.Powerpoint/Data/Documents/wef/
   ```
2. Quit PowerPoint completely (⌘Q) and reopen it.
3. Open a presentation. On the **Insert** tab, click the **Add-ins** dropdown (or **My Add-ins ▾**) — under **Developer Add-ins** you'll see **Live Poll**. Click it to insert the poll box onto the current slide.

**Windows:** sideloading uses a shared folder instead — follow Microsoft's guide
"[Sideload Office Add-ins on Windows](https://learn.microsoft.com/office/dev/add-ins/testing/create-a-network-shared-folder-catalog-for-task-pane-and-content-add-ins)", pointing it at this `manifest.xml`.

## Using it

1. **Save the file first.** The session code (and QR code) comes from the file's identity — an unsaved deck gives every slide its own temporary code.
2. **Sign in** inside the widget with the presenter account from step 1.6. You only need to do this when PowerPoint forgets the session (it usually remembers).
3. **Name the session.** Click the **⚙ gear** near the widget's top-right corner to open session settings. The **Session name** field names the whole presentation (it defaults to the filename). Voters see it on their phones and it becomes the session's title on their **My results** page — pick something memorable like the talk's title. The theme picker lives here too.
4. **Build:** insert Live Poll on any slide you want a question on (one question per slide). Type the question and answer choices. To make it a quiz question, pick the **Correct answer** from the dropdown — leave it on "No correct answer" for a plain poll. Click **Save question**. Resize/position the box like any other object.
5. **Present:** start the slideshow. When a poll slide appears, the box turns into a live bar chart with a QR code. The audience scans it once — after that, their phones follow along automatically as you move between poll slides.
6. **Reveal the answer:** once you're happy with the responses, click the **Reveal answer** button on the slide itself (next to the vote total). Voting closes, the correct choice gets a ✓ on screen, and every phone shows whether its vote was right. Click again (**Reopen voting**) to undo. On plain polls the button reads **Close voting** instead.
7. **Re-presenting to a new crowd?** Back in edit mode, open the **⚙ gear** settings in any poll widget and click **🔄 New audience — reset all votes** (click twice to confirm). Every count in the presentation returns to 0, voting reopens, revealed answers are hidden again, and everyone can vote once more. Questions are untouched.
8. **Control remotely (optional):** open `https://YOUR-URL/host.html?s=SESSIONCODE` on your phone or a second screen to open/close voting or reset individual questions. The session code is shown in the widget while editing.

## For the audience

- Scan the QR code → vote. No app, no account needed.
- Voters who **sign in** on the voting page (or create an account right there) get a
  personal answer history at `https://YOUR-URL/review.html` — every session they've
  answered, titled with your session name, with their quiz score.

## Good to know

- **One vote per phone per question.** Resetting a question (or the whole session) lets everyone vote again.
- **Votes are kept between showings** — closing PowerPoint doesn't clear them. Use **New audience** before re-presenting (see above).
- **Questions are saved inside the .pptx**, so the deck works on its own — and the same deck always keeps the same QR code. (Renaming or moving the file changes the session code.)
- **A re-vote replaces the old answer** in a voter's history — each question keeps one entry per session, so a reset round overwrites what that voter had before.
- **Privacy:** votes are anonymous counts (signed-in voters' history is private to them). The database rules let anyone read/write poll data — fine for live polling, but don't store anything sensitive in it.

## Troubleshooting

- **"Firebase isn't configured yet"** → re-check step 1.8, then re-upload `firebase-config.js` to GitHub.
- **"Sign-in failed"** → the presenter account must exist in Firebase **Authentication → Users**, and Email/Password sign-in must be enabled (steps 1.5–1.6).
- **Add-in doesn't appear in PowerPoint** → confirm the manifest is in the `wef` folder (step 4.1) and fully restart PowerPoint.
- **Blank box on the slide** → your GitHub Pages site may not be live yet (step 2.5), or the manifest URLs still have the old address.
- **A feature you just added doesn't show up** → the files on GitHub are stale. Re-upload the changed `docs` files and wait a minute; also try removing and re-inserting the widget (PowerPoint caches pages).
- **Phones don't update** → make sure the slideshow is running (questions only go "live" in slideshow mode) and the phone has internet.
- **Session name doesn't appear on results pages** → open the deck and sign in once in the widget; the name uploads automatically.
- **My results page can't load history** → the database rules must include the `users` section from step 1.4; re-publish them.
